![ETL pipeline diagram](https://github.com/jcw024/cryptobot-ETL-pipeline/blob/main/cryptobot%20pipeline.drawio.png)

ETL pipeline that migrates data generated by a crypto trading bot to an AWS RDS instance. The bot code is cloned from a popular open source python library called [freqtrade](https://github.com/freqtrade/freqtrade). 

## Tech Overview
1. The crypto trading bot is hosted on an AWS EC2 instance and stores trade information in a sqlite file
2. I created a cron job to copy the sqlite file into S3 every hour
3. A glue ETL script reads data from the sqlite files and writes the data to a postgres instance on AWS RDS daily
